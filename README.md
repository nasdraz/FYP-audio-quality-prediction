# FYP-audio-quality-prediction
 
This project explores the application of different machine learning models in audio quality prediction.The standard approaches using SVRs or MLPs suffer heavily from noisy data and do not follow amonotonic trend desirable in audio quality prediction. The approach taken in this project is theuse of lattices to enforce monotonic trends. The lattice and standard models were evaluated andcompared in their accuracy and monotonicity. The findings of this project show that the use oflattices can help develop more monotonic and predictable models, but at some cost in accuracy.This project concludes that domain knowledge can be successfully applied in audio quality prediction.The exploration of further methods of incorporating domain knowledge could see improvements inaudio quality prediction.
